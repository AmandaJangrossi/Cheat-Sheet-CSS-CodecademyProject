          <h2 class="secondary-title">What's Hierarchy?</h2>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Content hierarchy is the form of nesting elements inside HTML
            document. For the elements that nests other elements, we call
            'parents', and the ones who are being nested, we say 'child'
            elements.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            We can make a element hierarchy by using divs and spans, but there
            are better ways to do it! HTML has their own tags to make our code
            more semantic and readable.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            On the following image, we can notice how an HTML hierarchy is
            formed:
          </p>
          <img
            class="article-img"
            src="https://i0.wp.com/artechnologygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-3.png?w=847&ssl=1"
            alt="hierarchy importance"
          />
        </article>
        <article class="content-article">
          <h2 class="secondary-title">Why it's important?</h2>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Besides the fact of making our code more readable, using the correct
            tags when constructing our website helps the contend being more
            easily understandable for people with disabilities who have to use
            screen readers, therefore, also helps with website visibility and
            SEO ranking.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="content-article">
          <h2 class="secondary-title">How can I use it?</h2>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            HTML Hierarchy is something to be planned in advance! Like what was
            said before, is more than just structure, is a way of organizing
            things to be clear and objective, besides the fact that will
            optimize SEO and help people with some kind of disability. We can
            use by ordering the tags in a way that makes sense, main titles
            (like h1) should be used once in a page! Tags like h2 and h3,h4...
            should always respect their porpouse, using a h3 tag above an h2
            will work anyway, but it will confuse SEO and people who use screen
            readers.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            For a better content management and improved manuntetability, we can
            segment our site in parts, like we do with a human body!
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            First comes the head (or <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> in our case),
            here we gonna have the navigation links (like our menu).
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Then it comes the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> part, in here we gonna
            have our sections, articles, ... All of our site content. Speaking
            of that, we can always section our content in smaller parts, the tag
            <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> for example, can be used inside the
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag to determine the topics we are going
            to talk about (like sections of a periodic)
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Inside of that, we can have our
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> determining the content, having its own
            title, paragraphs, images, lists, tables,...
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Last, but not least, we have our <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. In
            there we can put our contact information, some social media links,
            adresses,...
          </p>

        <article class="content-article observation">
          <h3 class="side-title">Observations</h3>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            TLDR; Here are some observations to keep your HTML hierarchy concise
            and readable:
          </p>
          <ol class="article-list">
            <li>
              Keep an eye in your tags! The order that they're being used, makes
              sense in real life?
            </li>
            <li>Plan your website layout in advance</li>
            <li>
              Is not just for beauty, is for accessibility and SEO reasons
